<h1>//MOLLY BORIS</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>I am a poet and multimedia artist. I combine found images, 
      personal photographs, and contemporary motifs using ink and 
      paint to create symbols of my perceptions of beauty and gender
       roles. Rather than appealing to the sexes, I hope to just confuse
        them. Themes of feminism and absurdism are notable traits that
         can be seen in my work. I deconstruct the norms that oppress me,
         remove their weight, and implement a policy of abnormalities. I 
         create a new concept of beauty that exists beyond our conditioned 
         imagination. Iâ€™ve intertwined these subjects as a way to communicate
         my experiences as a woman. My work has been said to provoke thoughts 
         about the body, sex, advertisement, and fetishism. I paint and print 
         mostly in black and white, and I try to be economical with my use of 
         color. I like to convey a dissociative blankness that swallows a subject 
         matter. As a young radical, I have formed polarizing opinions about my own
         sex appeal and gender performance expectations. I draw my inspiration from 
         my everyday interactions with other women, and from my internalized experiences
         with the men. My work is heavily influenced by the DADA movement, The Dadaists,
         and Yayoi Kusama. DADA made a mockery of human behavior. Kusama translated her
         obsessive and intrusive thoughts into visionary spaces. Photographs of the human
         body and its parts are essential components in my work that I have reinvented 
         through assemblage as a response to the absurdity that I find in the standard of
         beauty and attraction. I consider my artwork to be a subconscious reflection of
         my own want to be desirable while simultaneously meeting conventional expectations
         with retaliation. I use my practice as a way of moving towards my own liberation. 
         I have spent years of my life trying to decode the complexes of beauty that surround me.
         I observe deeply beyond the surfaces of my environment and take careful consideration of
         what it really means to experience and embody beauty.
